# Project Documentation for Rose and Sunflower Image Classification

## Description

This project employs deep learning techniques to classify images into two categories: roses and sunflowers. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the aim is to demonstrate the CNNs' ability to recognize and differentiate complex visual features in images.

## Objectives

- Develop a precise and efficient image classification model.
- Apply data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance.
- Assess the model using standard metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for constructing and training deep learning models.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for project development and documentation.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Images are normalized and resized to prepare the data for training.
2. **Data Augmentation:** To increase the diversity of the training dataset, data augmentation techniques like rotation and scaling are applied.
3. **Model Construction:** A CNN architecture, optimized for image classification, is utilized.
4. **Training and Validation:** The model is trained with a training dataset and its performance validated with a validation dataset.
5. **Evaluation:** The final model is assessed using a test dataset to determine its accuracy and effectiveness in classifying new images.

# Advanced Documentation for the Rose and Sunflower Classification Model

## Introduction

This document details the methodology, neural network architecture, and results obtained in the rose and sunflower image classification project. Advanced deep learning techniques were used to distinguish between these two categories of images.

## Neural Network Architecture

### Base Convolutional Neural Network

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Images were resized to 180x180 pixels.
  - Pixel values were normalized to the range [0, 1].

- **Architecture**:
  - Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.
  - A flattening layer for the transition to dense layers.
  - A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
  - A dense output layer with 2 neurons (for sunflowers and roses) with softmax activation.

- **Compilation and Training**:
  - Optimizer: Adam.
  - Loss function: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy.
  - Metrics: Accuracy.
  - 10 epochs, showing continuous improvement in accuracy and loss reduction.

## Results

- **Final Training Accuracy**: Approximately 98.86%.
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: Approximately 94.77%.

## Suggested Improvements

- Implementation of early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Addition of dropout layers and the application of L2 regularization techniques.

## Conclusion

The model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in the training set and solid accuracy in the validation set. However, signs of overfitting were observed, suggesting the need for additional strategies to improve the model's generalization ability.
